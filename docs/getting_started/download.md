# Download

iRODS is released in both binary package format and with full source code.

## Binaries

RPM and DEB formats are available.  There are variations available for combinations of platform and operating system.

More combinations will be made available as our testing matrix continues to mature and increase in scope.

The latest packages can be downloaded from our APT and YUM repositories hosted at [https://packages.irods.org](https://packages.irods.org).

### Packages and Platform End-of-Life (EOL) Policy

The iRODS Consortium will publish packages for the lifetime of a supported platform. Once a platform reaches EOL, the iRODS Consortium will make a reasonable effort to provide one additional set of packages to aid administrators in gracefully moving to a new platform.

## Open Source

Code repositories, issue trackers, and milestones are available on GitHub.
