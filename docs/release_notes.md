 [All closed issues at the time of this release assigned to 4.1.11 are also included](https://github.com/irods/irods/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A4.1.11%20closed%3A%3C2017-06-08).  The most notable of these is [#3452](https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/3452), the subject of [CVE-2017-8799](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-8799).

## 4.2.0

Release Date: 2016-11-14

### Notable Features

  - [Pluggable Rule Engine](plugins/pluggable_rule_engine.md) - Seventh plugin interface now supports writing rule engines for any language. The iRODS Rule Language has been moved to a plugin, alongside a default policy C++ rule engine.

  - First Class API Plugins - Enabling dynamic policy enforcement points (PEPs) and full parameter serialization for every plugin operation

  - Refactored build system - CMake, Clang, APT/YUM repositories

    - CMake - Now a standard CMake project, much more developer friendly

    - Clang - All supported platforms now building the C++14 codebase

    - Packages separated - Cleaner dependencies, dev and runtime ready for developers

    - APT/YUM Repositories - Packages now hosted at RENCI, making installations and upgrades much easier

  - All control scripts in Python - Reusable module, reduced codepaths

  - New [process model](system_overview/process_model.md) - Two long running processes to amortize dynamic linking startup cost

  - Configuration schemas now included - Default setups will no longer need a public network connection for validation

  - Run-In-Place now a first class citizen - Now called [Non-Package Install](getting_started/installation.md#non-package-install-run-in-place)

### Notes

  - Externalization of code into separate repositories

    - iCommands client

    - Fuse client

    - Microservice objects (MSOs)

  - Consolidation of database plugin connection code to use unixODBC for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle

  - idbug removed

  - iphybun, ixmsg, irodsXmsgServer marked as deprecated

  - Resource hierarchies refactored to use IDs - Upgrades will experience a one-time full table scan whereby all data objects are updated.  A 10M data object lab test installation took 13 minutes to update.  100M data objects are estimated to take 2-3 hours to update.

  - [Distributing iCommands](system_overview/distributing_icommands.md) to users who do not have root is not yet supported for 4.2. It will be included again in a later release.

  - Quieter rodsLog during normal operations

## 4.1.10

Release Date: 2016-11-04

### Feature

 - New microservice, static PEPs to update unixfilesystem resource free_space [#3307] [#3312]

!!! Note
    Upgrading to 4.1.10 will not automatically add the two new static PEPs
    to `core.re`.  To avoid spurious DEBUG messages, add the following two
    empty definitions to core.re:

    - acPostProcForParallelTransferReceived(\*leaf_resource) {}
    - acPostProcForDataCopyReceived(\*leaf_resource) {}

!!! Note
    This updated feature (along with [#3306]) changes the optional
    unixfilesystem context string keyword from 'high_water_mark' to its
    semantic complement 'minimum_free_space_for_create_in_bytes'.  Using
    the deprecated 'high_water_mark' or 'required_free_inodes_for_create'
    will write a LOG_NOTICE to the server log.

### Bug Fixes

 - Fix for microservice parameter limitation [#3092] [#3095]

 - Fixes for unixfilesystem and free_space check [#3247] [#3305] [#3306] [#3311] [#3340]
