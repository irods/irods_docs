# API and ABI Stability

The iRODS Consortium strives to maintain API stability and not break backward compatibility within a major version. This statement applies to stable public APIs only. Experimental features and projects which have not reached 1.0 status may experience breaking changes. Consumers of these features and projects must keep that in mind as they consider deploying them into production.

The iRODS Consortium DOES NOT make any guarantees around ABI stability. This applies to iRODS libraries written in C, C++, and other languages which compile to machine code.
